    "## Seattle Fatal Police Encounters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "The death of George Floyd sparked major protests across Seattle that lasted for more than 100 days.  As a resident of Seattle I wanted to better understand how often this type of event happens in Seattle and how we compare to other cities. I also wanted to have some sense as to if the size of police force has a positive or negative relationship with fatal police encountres?  My hypothesises are that Seattle 1/ has a low rate of fatal police encounter incidents, and 2/ that policing is a complex topic and defunding is not the silver bullet that some protestors think it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically I would like to answer these 3 questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many peoplein Seattle die annually in encounters with police?\n",
    "2. How does Seattle compare to other similar cities across the United States?\n",
    "3. Is defunding the police the right decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete write up of the project motivation, modeling, and evaluation can be found here: https://medium.com/@jacobsworld/seattle-where-do-we-go-from-here-a-data-driven-look-at-fatal-police-encounters-4917adf67a76#443d-f0973affaf73\n"
